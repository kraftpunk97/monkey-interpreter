# Monkey Interpreter

Hi. This is an interpreter for the ["Monkey" Programming Language](https://www.monkeylang.org). It's a fictional language that is used to teach writing interpreters in Go. 

## Motivation
I worked on this during the holidays, to keep myself occupied, but then had to leave this project because the semester began and I got busy. Anyway, I found this project lying around in my Workspace directory and thought I should upload it on GitHub because it was getting stale. Maybe I'll pick it up later.

## Progress

I've completed the lexer and I am almost done with the parser. I have completed the functionalities of most of the keywords (haven't implemented loops yet).

I have also started working on the STL. This implementation has a working string class and linked lists.
